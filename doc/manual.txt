Introduction
What does it do?
Hype Error extends the domain record to define an error page for 404 errors. The page will be shown if a non-existing page is called. Additionally notifications can be configured to be sent, if the 404 error page is called. There’s also a simple frontend plugin which can be inserted in the 404 error page to display an appropriate message to the user.
